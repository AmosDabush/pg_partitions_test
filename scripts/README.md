# Partitioning Strategies in PostgreSQL

This document provides an overview and comparison of three partitioning strategies in PostgreSQL, highlighting their use cases, advantages, and disadvantages.

## 1. Temporary Partition for a Specific Hospital (Approach 1)

### **Overview**
- Uses `LIST` partitioning, with partitions created per hospital ID.
- Temporary partitions are created for updates, and data is swapped between the original and temporary partitions.
- Old partitions are dropped after swapping.

### **Steps**
1. Create a base table partitioned by hospital ID.
2. Create individual partitions for each hospital.
3. Create a temporary partition for updates.
4. Transfer data from the original partition to the temporary partition.
5. Add new data to the temporary partition.
6. Swap the temporary partition with the original partition.
7. Drop the old partition.

### **Advantages**
- Minimizes downtime by using temporary partitions.
- Updates are prepared separately, ensuring data consistency.

### **Disadvantages**
- Requires manual management of partitions for each hospital.
- High administrative overhead for systems with many hospitals.

### **Best Use Case**
- Suitable for small-scale systems with a limited number of hospitals requiring frequent updates.

## 2. Range-Based Partitioning (Approach 2)

### **Overview**
- Uses `RANGE` partitioning to group hospitals by ID ranges.
- Data is automatically routed to the appropriate partition based on the range.
- Unmatched data is stored in a default partition and migrated later.

### **Steps**
1. Create a base table partitioned by hospital ID ranges.
2. Create partitions for specific ranges (e.g., 1-100, 101-200).
3. Insert data into the base table; it will be routed to the correct partition.
4. If needed, migrate data from the default partition to a specific range partition.
5. Optionally, drop unused partitions.

### **Advantages**
- Simplifies partition management by grouping hospitals.
- Automatically routes data to the correct partition.

### **Disadvantages**
- Manual data migration from the default partition is required.
- Improper range planning may result in overflow.

### **Best Use Case**
- Ideal for medium-scale systems with logical groupings of hospitals.

## 3. Dynamic Range Partitioning with Auto-Creation (Approach 3)

### **Overview**
- Similar to Approach 2 but introduces dynamic partition creation.
- Checks for an existing partition and creates a new one if necessary.
- Automatically migrates data to the correct partition.

### **Steps**
1. Create a base table partitioned by hospital ID ranges.
2. Implement logic to check if a partition exists for a given range.
3. Dynamically create a new partition if it doesnâ€™t exist.
4. Insert data into the base table; it will be routed automatically.
5. Optionally, migrate unmatched data and drop unused partitions.

### **Advantages**
- Handles an unlimited number of hospital IDs dynamically.
- Reduces manual intervention for partition creation.
- Ensures no data remains in the default partition unless explicitly desired.

### **Disadvantages**
- Adds performance overhead due to dynamic checks.
- Requires additional logic for partition management.

### **Best Use Case**
- Best suited for large-scale systems with unpredictable hospital counts.

| Feature                          | Approach 1 (Temp Partitions) | Approach 2 (Range-Based) | Approach 3 (Dynamic Partitions) |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Partitioning Strategy            | LIST                        | RANGE                   | RANGE with dynamic creation    |
| Granularity                      | Per hospital                | Grouped by ranges       | Grouped by ranges (auto-extend)|
| Update Method                    | Partition swap              | Manual migration        | Auto-create and migrate        |
| Maintenance Overhead             | High                        | Medium                  | Low                             |
| Scalability                      | Limited                     | Moderate                | High                            |
| Suitable for                     | Small-scale systems         | Medium-scale systems    | Large-scale systems             |

## Conclusion

- **Approach 1**: Use for small systems where high control and minimal downtime are priorities.
- **Approach 2**: Use for medium-scale systems with logical groupings of hospitals.
- **Approach 3**: Use for large-scale, dynamic systems requiring automated partition management.
